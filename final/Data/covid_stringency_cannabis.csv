See archived webpage from WSDH website: https://web.archive.org/web/20200715081859/https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus/Resources    The Washington State Department of Health posted the following information on their COVID-19 Case Investigations and Contact Tracing webpage:  “Public health professionals perform case investigations and contact tracing to help slow and prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. Local health departments lead this work and the Washington State Department of Health and its partners support this work.”    Thus, King County, the largest county in Washington State*, was used to gauge the timeline of contact tracing policies for the OxCGRT Policy Tracker. On June 15th, King County noted on their application to move from Phase 2 to Phase 3 that the department was only contacting a percentage of contacts and cases.  See page 4, 12, & 13:  https://web.archive.org/web/20200724044800/https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/elected/executive/constantine/news/documents/2020/KC_Phase_2_Application_2020-06-15.ashx?la=en    Additionally, media sources have indicated that King County (and other counties in Washington State) appeared to be struggling to keep up with case and contact tracing needs. See archived sources below:    https://web.archive.org/web/20200724045829/https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/washington-has-1371-trained-officials-ready-to-begin-contact-tracing-on-the-coronavirus-inslee-says/  “Local health departments generally gave up contact tracing coronavirus cases months ago, after the disease became too widespread and their resources were stretched too thin. King County stopped contact tracing March 5.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20200724051450/https://apnews.com/4dc930ca385d1a4935f4381ee02f37c4  “The state has trained more than 2,100 people for the task. Contact tracing is a fundamental and decades-old public health tool, but Public Health — Seattle & King County had to stop investigating each case of the virus in early March, as the number of cases became overwhelming.”    https://web.archive.org/web/20200724045859/https://www.emsworld.com/news/1224505/covid-19-contact-tracing-wash-state-proving-challenging-public-health  “State workers took over the county's initial case investigations, and King County only followed up when a patient lived in or worked at a high-risk facility, such as a nursing home or homeless shelter. The shift allowed King County to """"focus on broad prevention strategies to reduce transmission"""" and managing the health care system as the virus spread, another spokesperson wrote in an e-mail.”    Because the first case of COVD-19 was confirmed on January 20th, 2020 (see archived link below), contact tracing for Washington State was presumed to have started on this day, as a part of the general public health system already in place.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200724050936/https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191    ---------  *King County is currently estimated to have the largest population in Washington State.

This includes coordination with local health departments, including Detroit and Wayne County Health Departments especially as Detroit Metropolitan Airport has become a 2019-nCoV screening location.

It's the first reported person under investigation for the virus in Montana, according to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services.     Jim Murphy, the state Communicable Disease Control bureau chief said that when people travel from China to the United States, those who are being allowed back in the country are screened by federal health workers for symptoms. Those who are not sick and travel back to their home states are flagged for the state health department. The state then works with local health departments to monitor those people for about two weeks, the longest known incubation period for the virus.

DHHS stated that travelers returning from China would need to self-monitor, and that local public health agencies were engaged in educating returned travelers about how to isolate, check symptoms twice daily, and report to their local public health agency.  DHHS again pointed businesses and employers to CDC guidance while recommending everyone practice hand washing and sanitizing, covering their coughs and sneezes, avoiding those who are sick, and staying home when ill.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200429011211/https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/3b2627fb-abe0-47d8-a8b4-ebdc612ea0f8/missouri-dhss-and-partners-continue-planning-and-preparing-for-novel-coronavirus  ",0,,0,,,,,,,,0,0,5.56,5.56,9.52,9.52,3.85,3.85,4.55,4.55,0,0

Access to the kits means DPHHS no longer has to send samples to the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia. For patients and family members, that means a much shorter wait time to see if they're infected. The state health department has also published a chart online to track how many people are being monitored for the virus, as well as the results of tests. As of 10 AM Friday, nine people in Montana were being monitored, and no patients have tested positive.

At least $1.05 billion of the previous aid package will go to state, local and tribal efforts through grants and cooperative agreements with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or as reimbursements from the federal government. The initial federal aid package was focused largely on public health concerns.

These executive orders banned price gouging in the state and ensure that critical services continue for our state’s most vulnerable.    Executive Order 20-10 prohibits price gouging during the peacetime emergency, responding to reports of essential goods necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of the public being sold at excessive and prohibitive prices. This prohibition took effect on Saturday, March 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m. Individuals found to be in violation are subject to investigation and enforcement by the Attorney General’s office. This executive order brings Minnesota, which does not have a statute on price gouging, in line with most other states in the United States.     Executive Order 20-11 authorized the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) to seek federal authority to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements for federal programs, including but not limited to the Minnesota Family Investment Program, Medical Assistance, and MinnesotaCare, to ensure these programs continue providing necessary support to Minnesota families during the COVID-19 pandemic.    Executive Order 20-12 allows DHS to temporarily issue waivers or modifications to state requirements to ensure that their services can be delivered to Minnesotans safely and without undue delay, protecting vulnerable Minnesotans and those who care for them. DHS provides health care coverage, programs, and services for over 1 million Minnesotans, including groups likely to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 such as older adults, individuals who have disabilities, families with children, and individuals with mental illness.

The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has received $14.9 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) in Pennsylvania to provide critical support and food to Pennsylvania’s food banks and emergency food assistance network working to feed the hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians. These funds were provided as a result of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act which was passed by Congress and enacted into law on March 18, 2020.    The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture will push $3.75 million in TEFAP money directly to 18 food banks in Pennsylvania to cover administrative costs associated with storage, transportation, and distribution of USDA Foods. In addition to this direct funding, the department will distribute $11.15 million in USDA Foods – including meats, vegetables, canned goods, cereal, rice, pasta, eggs, and more – to the state’s food banks to distribute through their network of distribution sites. The food and funding will be disbursed statewide to all 67 counties and distributed according to population and need.    Additionally, through an emergency contract with the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture is providing Hunger-Free Pennsylvania and their network of members $1 million in emergency funding for food and supplies.""""    http://archive.fo/Zk59w    original: https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-announces-nearly-16-million-in-funding-for-pennsylvania-food-banks/",31652,1042,65.74,65.74,67.86,67.86,63.46,63.46,61.36,61.36,75,75

MDHHS is contracting with Great Lakes Community Engagement, a firm that specializes in outreach campaigns to engage citizens, and Every Action VAN, a voter/individual contact platform used by non-profits, to provide software to help organize remote phone banking and track information and contacts.    More than 2,200 volunteers have completed MDHHS’ contact tracing training and are ready to begin aiding local health departments. This workforce will increase the speed and thoroughness of contact tracing statewide. These volunteers are in addition to more than 130 MDHHS staff who have been assisting local health departments with case investigation over the past couple weeks and have reached more than 12,000 COVID-positive individuals.    Dedicating additional resources to contact tracing is needed as testing criteria and testing locations are rapidly expanding. Last week, MDHHS announced the expansion of testing to all Michiganders experiencing symptoms. Starting April 21, testing eligibility criteria is being expanded again to include all essential workers still reporting to work in person with potential COVID-19 exposure, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic.

As a result, each county in Washington was at a different phase at any given time.

This timeframe was used in estimating the generalized response of WA state COVID-19 policies.   Phase 1 for King County lasted through June 18th, 2020, and did not allow gatherings outside of households (with the exception of some religious gatherings). By default, public gatherings were banned by nature of not being able to gather. This was confirmed by the city of Seattle not issuing permits for major events until further notice.

It addresses where a person may have been exposed to the disease and also to whom they may have transmitted it. Immediately after an individual has been tested, the Health Department will begin a case investigation and contact tracing. While waiting for results, the individual will be asked to stay home. If they test positive, they will be called by the Health Department and asked to look back at their potential contacts over the past 14 days to help determine from whom they may have contracted the disease. They will also be asked to review the past 48 hours, before the onset of symptoms, to determine who they may have infected. Since the first positive test in Richland County, the Health Department reportedly has made over 80 calls to the positive cases and their close contacts.

As counties in the commonwealth move from the red stay-at-home order to the aggressive mitigation efforts of the yellow phase, the Department of Health will be conducting extensive case histories investigations as part of contact tracing on those who test positive for the virus.    The department has chosen to work with Sara Alert, a new data collection platform and has requested a system modification to the platform to collect sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data.

Asymptomatic People in Congregate Settings  Congregate living settings including long term care facilities, shelters, and prisons. Testing should  be done according to guidance issued by MDH.  Staff Working in High Risk Settings  Employees working in high risk areas, including those working in hospital/clinic settings where  there is direct contact with COVID-19 patients, those working in long-term care facilities, shelter  workers, and prison guards. It is likely that some people will need testing on a regular basis  because of repeated high-risk exposures in the workplace. If a point-prevalence survey is done in a  facility, staff should be included as part of the prioritization for the facility-wide testing. If not  testing everyone, prioritize:  1. Symptomatic staff  2. Asymptomatic staff ending their quarantine period  3. Asymptomatic staff who work in a facility that has COVID-19 cases  Cluster Investigations  Cluster investigations where groups of people are associated with a case of COVID-19, even if a  direct contact isn’t identified. This could include specific workplace-wide or facility-wide clusters  implicated to have outbreaks of COVID-19. The testing approach should be done in consultation  with MDH.  Asymptomatic People Requiring Medical Care  Examples include: Patients planning to undergo an aerosol-generating procedure (procedure  involving the airway or esophagus such as intubation, bronchoscopy, upper esophageal  endoscopy, dental procedures, etc.), or patients undergoing other procedures that may be delayed  based on testing results (patients undergoing procedures like chemotherapy, cardiac surgery, or  other procedures in which COVID-19 infection may worsen outcome) or patients admitted to the  hospital.

Those types of gatherings are now permitted indoors so long as they do not exceed 100 attendees or 25% of the capacity of the space in which the gathering is held, whichever is lower. State public health directives now do not prohibit in-person outdoor faith-based services or protests as long as face coverings are worn and physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. All other gatherings are prohibited until further notice, except as otherwise specifically permitted in state public health directives (including in applicable industry guidance).

In Helena, drive-through testing will be conducted at PureView Health Center on Saturday June 6, and Saturday June 13.    “The point is really to see if there is COVID in the community among asymptomatic people,” said Purview Health Center CEO Jill-Marie Steeley. “This kind of screening test is for people who do not have symptoms and do not have any known exposure to COVID.”    The hope is that this screening will give public health a better idea of the prevalence of COVID-19 in local communities and the state. The testing is through an initiative by Governor Steve Bullock, is completely free to the individual and paid for by the State of Montana.

This virus is unpredictable and has upended our regular ways of doing everything. Therefore, if COVID cases spike or spread, we may need to reassess this plan. We cannot guarantee that school will open in fall. But for now, this guidance provides a path that schools, educators and families need to plan for the coming months and the fall.

COVID-19 housing debt” means a money debt resulting at least in part from a breach of a residential lease, residential executory contract, or residential mortgage due to failure to make a required payment during a state of emergency or state of disaster arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic.  A conditional dismissal, pursuant to Michigan Court Rule 2.602, of a claim based on COVID-19 housing debt may provide for the Eviction Diversion Program (EDP) or any similar relief fund established at the county or municipal level to satisfy up to 90% of the amount due to the plaintiff via a lump sum rental assistance payment, subject to availability of funds.  Rental assistance under this section is available only for COVID-19 housing debt.  Non-COVID-19 housing debt must be paid by the tenant either in a lump sum or as part of a conditional dismissal.  A conditional dismissal that includes EDP rental assistance must require the defendant’s share of the amount due to be paid in 12 equal monthly payments.  In order to receive a lump sum rental assistance payment, plaintiff must waive any late fees or penalties, and must forgive one-ninth of one dollar of the remaining amount due for every dollar received as a lump sum payment. For example: (i) if a plaintiff receives $900 from the Eviction Diversion Program on a $1,000 arrearage, they must forgive the remaining $100; (ii) if a plaintiff receives $450 from the Eviction Diversion Program on a $1,000 arrearage, they must forgive $50, and the defendant tenant is responsible for paying the remaining $500 in twelve equal monthly payments.  Eligibility for rental assistance payments under section 3 will be based on tenant income and household size.  Households up to 100% of area median income (AMI), calculated based on income during the period for which assistance is sought, will be eligible for rental assistance, with a target of half of funds reserved for households earning less than 50% of AMI.  Tenant responsibility will vary based on AMI and amount due.  The Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO) must issue program guidance to implement this section.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200710011057/https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90705-533074--,00.html",0,,0,,2,1,,3,,1,,0,,0,,,,69329,6134,46.3,46.3,60.71,60.71,47.44,47.44,51.52,51.52,25,25

The order was initially issued until July 31.     Individuals are required to wear a mask when they are within six feet of people from other households in public indoor spaces, on public transportation, and in gatherings of ten or more when outdoors. The order created exceptions for “practical necessity,” such as with young children and when eating or drinking; for exercise; for “effective communication” where “the ability to see the person’s mouth is essential for communication”; for voting or limited religious reasons; and for essential job functions of first responders and where wearing a face mask would violate industry safety protocols.     The order also calls for businesses to encourage employees and customers to wear face masks, but does not require that they do so.

The period of self-quarantine continues to begin at the time of arrival through 14 days or for the duration of the visit – whichever is shorter.

Today, between Minnesota Department of Health and local public health officials, plus a contractor with workers available to provide surge staffing, there are currently a potential 800 people making contact tracing phone calls in Minnesota.    How many contact tracers are needed to adequately manage a pandemic depends on whom you ask, and what the spread of COVID-19 looks like at any given time. A staffing calculator by researchers at George Washington University suggests a baseline of 15 tracers per 100,000 population, which suggests Minnesota would need about 882. But it also has a staffing output that takes into account current case loads and suggests Minnesota needs more than 3,000 contact tracers.    While MDH claims that it currently has enough contact tracers, a number of unconnnected cases keeps appearing, suggesting that the contact tracing is not done to the extent justifying a 2 - although it is likely close to that treshhold.  http://archive.vn/snkMp  https://www.minnpost.com/health/2020/07/minnesota-is-contacting-people-who-have-been-exposed-to-covid-19-cases-at-current-infection-rates-it-might-not-do-much-good/ (webarchive unavailable)",,,,,,,52281,1620,53.7,53.7,59.52,59.52,50,50,54.55,54.55,25,25
